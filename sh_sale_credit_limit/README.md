About
============
A credit limit is the maximum amount of credit offered to a customer. You can set a credit limit for every customer using this module. For example, a manager grants a credit limit of $5,000 to a customer. The credit limit is used to limit the amount of loss that order will on hold if a customer does not pay. you can also notify the customer by email when a customer crosses his credit limit. And that order status will automatically set 'On hold'. This module also provides a different way to notify the customer by email.
